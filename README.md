# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using the **K-Means Clustering algorithm** on mall customer data. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on demographics and spending behavior, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies.

## 📁 Dataset

**Mall_Customers_5.csv**  
- `CustomerID` — Unique customer identifier  
- `Gender` — Male/Female  
- `Age` — Age of customer  
- `Annual Income (k$)` — Income in thousands  
- `Spending Score (1–100)` — Score assigned based on customer behavior

## 📅 Week-wise Progress

### ✅ Week 1 – Data Loading, Cleaning & EDA
- Loaded customer dataset
- Performed null checks and data inspection
- Created summary statistics
- Visualized age, income, and spending distribution
- Encoded categorical variables (like Gender)
- Scaled features for clustering

---

### ✅ Week 2 – K-Means Clustering
- Applied K-Means algorithm
- Used **Elbow Method** to find optimal number of clusters
- Used **Silhouette Score** for validation
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots and PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

---

### ✅ Week 3 – Cluster Analysis & Business Insights
- Labeled and profiled clusters
- Identified customer groups: High Income–High Spend, Low Income–Low Spend, etc.
- Described behavioral traits of each group
- Suggested marketing strategies for each segment

---

### ✅ Week 4 – Final Report & Documentation
- Prepared summary report with charts and conclusions
- Created GitHub project structure
- Included notebooks, dataset, screenshots, and documentation
